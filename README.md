# Customer Segmentation Using Principal-Component-Analysis (PCA)
This project is a simple implementation of Customer Segmentation using PCA from classical wine dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning located at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine. 

###  What is PCA?
PCA is a technique for analyzing quantitative data  to help  reduce dimensionality, noise, and extract important information (features / attributes) from large amount of data.

### Dataset
The dataset contains results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. To implement customer segmentation an additional column is added to this dataset which indicates the customer segment of individuals who like certain attributes of a wine. 
Data has following 13 attributes
1. Alcohol
2. Malic_acid
3. Ash
4. Alcalinity_of_ash
5. Magnesium
6. Total_phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid_phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
20. Color_intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280
13. Proline
14. Customer_Segment

All the variables provided are continious.
